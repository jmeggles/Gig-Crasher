## Features
This project uses APIs of SkyScanner and Ticketmaster. These APIs combined give an user an opportunity to find more information using just one application. Nice and simple interface is not distracting the customer and the result of the input search has images and an active link to  the event itself that is also very convenient.


## Code Example
Here is a pice of code for the AJAX method using ScyScanner API
     var city = $("#searchDestination").val()

        if (!isChecked) {

            var settings = {
                "async": true,
                "crossDomain": true,
                "url": "https://skyscanner-skyscanner-flight-search-v1.p.rapidapi.com/apiservices/autosuggest/v1.0/UK/GBP/en-GB/?query=" + city,
                "method": "GET",
                "headers": {
                    "x-rapidapi-host": "skyscanner-skyscanner-flight-search-v1.p.rapidapi.com",
                    "x-rapidapi-key": "f4e7fa0f3amsh07cbec10686c47cp142668jsne2338ac4ac2e"
                }
            }

            $.ajax(settings).done(function (response) {
                $("#flights").empty();
                var flights = "";

                for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
                    $("#flights").html(flights);
                    flights += "<div id='flightsoptions'> Destination Airport:" + [i + 1] + "<br>";
                    flights += "<p>" + response.Places[i].CountryName + "</p>";
                    flights += "<p>" + response.Places[i].PlaceName + "</p>";
                    flights += "<p id='lastitem'>" + response.Places[i].PlaceId + "</p>";
                }
            });
        }
